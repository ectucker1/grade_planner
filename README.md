# grade_planner

A planner for Mr. Smith's gradeless grading system. Written with Polymer Dart.

The source is in the master branch, the compiled javascript is in gh-pages.

A working site can be found here: http://specialcode.github.io/grade_planner/

The site does not work in IE or Edge. Firefox and Chrome are fine. I don't know about Safari and Opera.
